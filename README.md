Interactively build [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) expressions ([gojq](https://github.com/itchyny/gojq)

This zsh plugin gives you jq superpowers!

## Installation

Besides [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), this plugin also requires
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation)
([a recent version](https://github.com/reegnz/jq-zsh-plugin/issues/19)) to be installed and available on your
PATH.

The following installation methods are proven to work:

- [Oh My Zsh](#oh-my-zsh)
- [zplug](#zplug)
- [Antigen](#antigen)
- [Zgen](#zgen)

### [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/reegnz/jq-zsh-plugin.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/jq
```

2. Add the plugin to the list of plugins for Oh My Zsh to load (inside `~/.zshrc`):

```sh
plugins=(
	# other plugins...
	jq
)
```

3. Start a new terminal session.

### [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug)

```sh
zplug reegnz/jq-zsh-plugin
```

### [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

```sh
antigen bundle reegnz/jq-zsh-plugin
```

### [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

```sh
zgen load reegnz/jq-zsh-plugin
```

## Usage

- type out a command that you expect to produce json on its standard output
- press alt + j
- start typing jq expression and watch it being evaluated in real time (like a true
  [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)!)
- use up/down and hit tab to select one of the suggestions
- or type out a jq query on your own
- press enter, and the jq expression is appended to your initial command!

## Key bindings

Bringing up the jq query builder for a shell command: `alt + j`

During interactive querying, the following shortcuts can be used:

| Shortcut                 | Effect                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `ctrl-k` or `up`         | Navigate path queries                            |
| `ctrl-j` or `down`       | Navigate path queries                            |
| `tab`                    | Select path query                                |
| `ctrl-p` or `shift-up`   | Scroll up                                        |
| `ctrl-n` or `shift-down` | Scroll down                                      |
| `ctrl-alt-p`             | Scroll up half page                              |
| `ctrl-alt-n`             | Scroll down half page                            |
| `alt-up`                 | Scroll up full page                              |
| `alt-down`               | Scroll down full page                            |
| `ctrl-r`                 | Reload input                                     |
| `ctrl-y`                 | Yank selected path to clipboard (GNU/Linux only) |

## gojq support

If you want to use an alternative `jq` implementation, like [gojq](https://github.com/itchyny/gojq) then you
can override the default jq command used by the plugin. Set the following environment variable:

```sh
JQ_REPL_JQ=gojq
```

## Internals

The project consists of the following components:

- a `jq.plugin.zsh` providing a
  [user-defined zsh line-editor widget](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html),
  utilizing the `jq-repl` command
- a `jq-repl` command to interactively build jq expressions, utilizing fzf for its UI
- a `jq-paths` command to get all valid jq paths in the provided JSON document, used for suggesting paths.

## Troubleshooting

### MacOS: Pressing alt-j creates a `∆` symbol in iTerm2

You need to remap your alt-key to `Esc+` in iTerm2:

- `Cmd + ,` to enter preferences
- Go to Profiles
- select your profile from the pane on the left hand side
- go to the keys tab
- Set Left Option (⌥ ) Key to `Esc+`

See other suggestions on stackoverflow if the above one doesn't help you:
https://stackoverflow.com/q/196357/205318

Another option is to map to `ctrl+j` instead by putting this in your `.zshrc`:

```sh
bindkey `^j` jq-complete
```

### Disable expanding shell aliases

The plugin automatically expands shell aliases in a command before passing it to `jq-repl`. To disable, put
the following line into your `.zshrc`:

```sh
JQ_ZSH_PLUGIN_EXPAND_ALIASES=0
```
